# FNP-Sales-Analysis(Excel)-
Sales Analysis and Dashboard creation 
This project presents a dynamic Excel-based dashboard designed to analyze and visualize sales data for FNP (Ferns N Petals). The dashboard offers an interactive view of key performance indicators, allowing users to explore sales patterns across multiple dimensions such as occasion, product, time, and city.

The dashboard is developed using Excelâ€™s built-in features, including pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and timelines. Minimal use of formulas and VBA ensures that the solution remains lightweight and easy to customize.
